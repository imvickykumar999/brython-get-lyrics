# [Brython Songs Lyrics](https://imvickykumar999.github.io/brython-get-lyrics/)

## Being a python developer I don't have any idea of javascript. So I used Brython which transcripts the Python code to equivalent Javascript code. Overall things used:
- Brython: Handling the API calls 
- HTML: Basic web structure
- CSS: Some refining
- Github pages: For deployment purpose making it working 24x7!
- Lyrics API: Which returns the results

## Here is the quick GIF if live demo fails to perform due to slow API!
